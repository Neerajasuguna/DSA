Given an array of N integers, write a program to return an element that occurs more than N/2 times in the given array. You may consider that such an element always exists in the array.

Examples

Example 1:
Input Format: N = 3, nums[] = {3,2,3}
Result: 3
Explanation: When we just count the occurrences of each number and compare with half of the size of the array, you will get 3 for the above solution. 

Example 2:
Input Format:  N = 7, nums[] = {2,2,1,1,1,2,2}

Result: 2

Explanation: After counting the number of times each element appears and comparing it with half of array size, we get 2 as result.


1. Simple Solution 

Use a hashmap and store as (key, value) pairs. (Can also use frequency array based on the size of nums) 
Here the key will be the element of the array and the value will be the number of times it occurs. 
Traverse the array and update the value of the key. Simultaneously check if the value is greater than the floor of N/2. 
If yes, return the key 
Else iterate forward.


public static int majorityElement(int []v) {
        //size of the given array:
        int n = v.length;

        //declaring a map:
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> mpp = new HashMap<>();

        //storing the elements with its occurnce:
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int value = mpp.getOrDefault(v[i], 0);
            mpp.put(v[i], value + 1);
        }

        //searching for the majority element:
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> it : mpp.entrySet()) {
            if (it.getValue() > (n / 2)) {
                return it.getKey();
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }




Optimal Approach: Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm:
Intuition:
If the array contains a majority element, its occurrence must be greater than the floor(N/2). Now, we can say that the count of minority elements and majority elements is equal up to a certain point in the array. So when we traverse through the array we try to keep track of the count of elements and the element itself for which we are tracking the count. 

After traversing the whole array, we will check the element stored in the variable. If the question states that the array must contain a majority element, the stored element will be that one but if the question does not state so, then we need to check if the stored element is the majority element or not. If not, then the array does not contain any majority element.



public static int majorityElement(int []v) {
        //size of the given array:
        int n = v.length;
        int cnt = 0; // count
        int el = 0; // Element

        //applying the algorithm:
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (cnt == 0) {
                cnt = 1;
                el = v[i];
            } else if (el == v[i]) cnt++;
            else cnt--;
        }

        //checking if the stored element
        // is the majority element:
        int cnt1 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (v[i] == el) cnt1++;
        }

        if (cnt1 > (n / 2)) return el;
        return -1;
    }



    Time Complexity: O(N) + O(N), where N = size of the given array.
Reason: The first O(N) is to calculate the count and find the expected majority element. The second one is to check if the expected element is the majority one or not.

Note: If the question states that the array must contain a majority element, in that case, we do not need the second check. Then the time complexity will boil down to O(N).

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
