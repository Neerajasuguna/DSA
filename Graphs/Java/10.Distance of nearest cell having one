You are given an n x m binary matrix (0s and 1s). For every cell containing 0, find the distance to the nearest cell containing 1
(in terms of steps via up/down/left/right). Return the matrix of the same size with those distances.


✅ BFS Approach (Multi-source BFS):
Push all the cells with value 1 into the queue.
Mark their distance as 0, and all others as -1 initially.
Then use BFS to spread from 1s and calculate the minimum distance for 0s.



public class NearestOneDistance {
    public int[][] updateMatrix(int[][] mat) {
        int rows = mat.length;
        int cols = mat[0].length;

        int[][] dist = new int[rows][cols];
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];

        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        // Step 1: Add all 1s to the queue
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 1) {
                    queue.add(new int[]{i, j});
                    visited[i][j] = true;
                    dist[i][j] = 0;
                } else {
                    dist[i][j] = -1; // initialize other cells
                }
            }
        }

        int[] dx = {-1, 1, 0, 0};
        int[] dy = {0, 0, -1, 1};

        // Step 2: Multi-source BFS
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cell = queue.poll();
            int x = cell[0], y = cell[1];

            for (int d = 0; d < 4; d++) {
                int newX = x + dx[d];
                int newY = y + dy[d];

                if (newX >= 0 && newX < rows && newY >= 0 && newY < cols
                        && !visited[newX][newY]) {
                    dist[newX][newY] = dist[x][y] + 1;
                    queue.add(new int[]{newX, newY});
                    visited[newX][newY] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        return dist;
    }


Time Complexity:
O(n * m) where n and m are dimensions of the matrix (each cell visited once).

📌 Space Complexity:
O(n * m) for visited array and queue.



Is visited matrix needed ? 
yes becuse here we are not chnaging the intial matrix , so keep track of which cell is processed , we need viisted matrix , unless  like for example in rotten oranges we are changing the 
row or cell to rotten , so dont need vvisted matrix
