Intuition:

Since we know topological sorting is only possible for directed acyclic graphs(DAGs) if we apply Kahnâ€™s algorithm in a directed cyclic graph(A directed graph that contains a cycle), it will fail to find the topological sorting(i.e. The final sorting will not contain all the nodes or vertices). 
So, finally, we will check the sorting to see if it contains all V vertices or not. If the result does not include all V vertices, we can conclude that there is a cycle. 
Note: The intuition is to check the size of the final topological sorting if it equals V(no. of vertices or nodes) or not.


Approach: 
We will apply the BFS(Breadth First Search) traversal technique. Breadth First Search or BFS is a traversal technique where we visit the nodes level-wise, i.e., it visits the same level nodes simultaneously, and then moves to the next level.

Initial Configuration:

Indegree Array: Initially all elements are set to 0. Then, We will count the incoming edges for a node and store it in this array. For example, if indegree of node 3 is 2, indegree[3] = 2.

Queue: As we will use BFS, a queue is required. Initially, the node with indegree 0 will be pushed into the queue.

Answer array(Optional): Initially empty and is used to store the linear ordering.

The algorithm steps are as follows:

First, we will calculate the in-degree of each node and store it in the in-degree array. We can iterate through the given adj list, and simply for every node u->v, we can increase the in-degree of v by 1 in the in-degree array. 
Initially, there will be always at least a single node whose indegree is 0. So, we will push the node(s) with in-degree 0 into the queue.
Then, we will pop a node from the queue including the node in our answer array, and for all its adjacent nodes, we will decrease the in-degree of that node by one. For example, if node u that has been popped out from the queue has an edge towards node v(u->v), we will decrease indegree[v] by 1.
After that, if for any node the in-degree becomes 0, we will push that node again into the queue.
We will repeat steps 3 and 4 until the queue is completely empty. Now, completing the BFS we will get the linear ordering of the nodes in the answer array.
Finally, we will check the length of the answer array. If it equals V(no. of nodes) then the algorithm will return false otherwise it will return true.
Space Optimization:

In this particular algorithm, we are only concerned about the length of the topological sorting and not the exact nodes it contains. So in step 3, after popping a node out of the queue, instead of putting it into an array we can carry a counter variable and increment it. After completing the BFS this counter variable will give the length of the topological sorting. So, we need not use the extra answer.

		// o(v + e)
		while (!q.empty()) {
			int node = q.front();
			q.pop();
			cnt++;
			// node is in your topo sort
			// so please remove it from the indegree

			for (auto it : adj[node]) {
				indegree[it]--;
				if (indegree[it] == 0) q.push(it);
			}

		if (cnt == V) return false;
		return true;

	//V = 6;
	vector<int> adj[6] = {{}, {2}, {3}, {4, 5}, {2}, {}};
	int V = 6;
	Solution obj;
	bool ans = obj.isCyclic(V, adj);
	if (ans) cout << "True";
	else cout << "Flase";
	cout << endl;
	return 0;
}




Time Complexity: O(V+E), where V = no. of nodes and E = no. of edges. This is a simple BFS algorithm.

Space Complexity: O(N) + O(N) ~ O(2N), O(N) for the in-degree array, and O(N) for the queue data structure used in BFS(where N = no.of nodes).
