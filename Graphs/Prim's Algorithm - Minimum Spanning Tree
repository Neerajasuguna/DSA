A tree with n nodes and n-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other  -- Spanning Tree

A Minimum Spannin gTree is the spanning tree with sum of edges to be min of all spanning trees possible 

The intuition of this algorithm is the greedy technique used for every node. If we carefully observe, for every node, we are greedily selecting its unvisited adjacent node with the minimum edge weight(as the priority queue here is a min-heap and the topmost element is the node with the minimum edge weight). Doing so for every node,
we can get the sum of all the edge weights of the minimum spanning tree and the spanning tree itself(if we wish to) as well.





#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution
{
public:
	//Function to find sum of weights of edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree.
	int spanningTree(int V, vector<vector<int>> adj[])
	{
		priority_queue<pair<int, int>,
		               vector<pair<int, int> >, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;

		vector<int> vis(V, 0);
		// {wt, node}
		pq.push({0, 0});
		int sum = 0;
		while (!pq.empty()) {
			auto it = pq.top();
			pq.pop();
			int node = it.second;
			int wt = it.first;

			if (vis[node] == 1) continue;
			// add it to the mst
			vis[node] = 1;
			sum += wt;
			for (auto it : adj[node]) {
				int adjNode = it[0];
				int edW = it[1];
				if (!vis[adjNode]) {
					pq.push({edW, adjNode});
				}
			}
		}
		return sum;
	}
};


int main() {

	int V = 5;
	vector<vector<int>> edges = {{0, 1, 2}, {0, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 1}, {2, 3, 2}, {3, 4, 1}, {4, 2, 2}};
	vector<vector<int>> adj[V];
	for (auto it : edges) {
		vector<int> tmp(2);
		tmp[0] = it[1];
		tmp[1] = it[2];
		adj[it[0]].push_back(tmp);

		tmp[0] = it[0];
		tmp[1] = it[2];
		adj[it[1]].push_back(tmp);
	}

	Solution obj;
	int sum = obj.spanningTree(V, adj);
	cout << "The sum of all the edge weights: " << sum << endl;

	return 0;
}
Output: The sum of all the edge weights: 5

Time Complexity: O(E*logE) + O(E*logE)~ O(E*logE), where E = no. of given edges.
The maximum size of the priority queue can be E so after at most E iterations the priority queue will be empty and the loop will end. Inside the loop, there is a pop operation that will take logE time. This will result in the first O(E*logE) time complexity. Now, inside that loop, for every node, we need to traverse all its adjacent nodes where the number of nodes can be at most E. If we find any node unvisited, we will perform a push operation and for that, we need a logE time complexity. So this will result in the second O(E*logE). 

Space Complexity: O(E) + O(V), where E = no. of edges and V = no. of vertices. O(E) occurs due to the size of the priority queue and O(V) due to the visited array. If we wish to get the mst, we need an extra O(V-1) space to store the edges of the most.
