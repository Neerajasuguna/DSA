Given a n * m matrix grid where each element can either be 0 or 1. You need to find the shortest distance between a given source cell to a destination cell. The path can only be created out of a cell if its value is 1. 

If the path is not possible between source cell and destination cell, then return -1.

Note : You can move into an adjacent cell if that adjacent cell is filled with element 1. Two cells are adjacent if they share a side. In other words, you can move in one of the four directions, Up, Down, Left and Right. The source and destination cell are based on the zero based indexing. The destination cell should be 1.

Example 1:

Input:
grid[][] = {{1, 1, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 0, 1},
            {1, 1, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 0, 0},
            {1, 0, 0, 1}}
source = {0, 1}
destination = {2, 2}
Output:
3
Explanation:
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
The highlighted part in the matrix denotes the 
shortest path from source to destination cell.
Example 2:

Input:
grid[][] = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 1, 1, 0},
            {1, 0, 1, 0, 1}}
source = {0, 0}
destination = {3, 4}
Output:
-1
Explanation:
The path is not possible between source and 
destination, hence return -1.
Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function shortestPath() which takes the a 2D integer array grid, source cell and destination cell as an input parameters and returns the shortest distance between source and destination cell.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n * m)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n * m)


why queue not priority queue: 
the distances are increasing monotonically (because of constant edge weights). Since greater distance comes at the top automatically, 
so we do not need the priority queue as the pop operation will always pop the smaller distance which is at the front of the queue. 
This helps us to eliminate an additional log(N) of time needed to perform insertion-deletion operations in a priority queue.


Initial configuration:

Source Node and Destination Node: Before starting off with the Algorithm, we need to define a source node and a destination node, between which we need the shortest possible distance.
Queue: Define a Queue which would contain pairs of the type {dist, pair of coordinates of cell }, where ‘dist’ indicates the currently updated value of the shortest distance from the source to the cell.
Distance Matrix: Define a distance matrix that would contain the distance from the source cell to that particular cell. If a cell is marked as ‘infinity’ then it is treated as unreachable/unvisited.
The Algorithm consists of the following steps :

Start by creating a queue that stores the distance-node pairs in the form {dist, coordinates of cell pair} and a dist matrix with each cell initialized with a very large number ( to indicate that they’re unvisited initially) and the source cell marked as ‘0’.
We push the source cell to the queue along with its distance which is also 0.
Pop the element at the front of the queue and look out for its adjacent nodes (left, right, bottom, and top cell). Also, for each cell, check the validity of the cell if it lies within the limits of the matrix or not.
If the current reachable distance to a cell from the source is better than the previous distance indicated by the distance matrix, we update the distance and push it into the queue along with cell coordinates.
A cell with a lower distance would be at the front of the queue as opposed to a node with a higher distance. We repeat the above two steps until the queue becomes empty or until we encounter the destination node.
Return the calculated distance and stop the algorithm from reaching the destination node. If the queue becomes empty and we don’t encounter the destination node, return ‘-1’ indicating there’s no path from source to destination.
