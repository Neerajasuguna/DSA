Intuition:

For finding the shortest path in an undirected graph with unit weight, the technique we use is the Breadth-First Search (BFS). Now, the question arises why do we use the BFS technique in finding the shortest path here when we could’ve easily used other standard graph shortest path algorithms to implement the same? If we start traversal from the src node, we move to other adjacent nodes, everyone is at a distance of 1, so everyone goes into the queue, then subsequently we get the next set of nodes at 1 more distance, making the distance to 2, and if you look at the queue closely, 
it will look something like below. Queue here acts as a sorted Queue, hence we don’t need any sorted ds which we generally require in the other graph algorithms.




The shortest path in an undirected graph can be calculated by the following steps:

Firstly, we convert the graph into an adjacency list which displays the adjacent nodes for each index represented by a node.
Now, we create a dist array of size N initialized with a very large number which can never be the answer to indicate that initially, all the nodes are untraversed.
Then, perform the standard BFS traversal. 
In every iteration, pick up the front() node, and then traverse for its adjacent nodes.  For every adjacent node, we will relax the distance to the adjacent node if (dist[node] + 1 < dist[adjNode]).
Here dist[node] means the distance taken to reach the current node, and ‘1’ is the edge weight between the node and the adjNode. We will relax the edges if this distance is shorter than the previously taken distance. 
Every time a distance is updated for the adjacent node, we push that into the Queue with the increased distance.

Time Complexity: O(M) { for creating the adjacency list from given list ‘edges’} + O(N + 2M) { for the BFS Algorithm} + O(N) { for adding the final values of the shortest path in the resultant array} ~ O(N+2M). 

Where N= number of vertices and M= number of edges.

Space Complexity:  O( N) {for the stack storing the BFS} + O(N) {for the resultant array} + O(N) {for the dist array storing updated shortest paths} + O( N+2M) {for the adjacency list} ~ O(N+M) .

Where N= number of vertices and M= number of edges.
