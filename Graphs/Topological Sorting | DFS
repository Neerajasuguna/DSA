Linear ordering of vertices such that if there is edge between u and v , then u appeares before v . topological sort can be done only for Direct Acyclic graph

Given an adjacency list for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where adj_list[i] contains a list of all vertices j such that there is a directed edge from vertex i to vertex j, with  V  vertices and E  edges, your task is to find any valid topological sorting of the graph.

 

In a topological sort, for every directed edge u -> v,  u must come before v in the ordering.



Intuition 

Approach: 

We will be solving it using the DFS traversal technique. DFS goes in-depth, i.e., traverses all nodes by going ahead, and when there are no further nodes to traverse in the current path, then it backtracks on the same path and traverses other unvisited nodes.

The algorithm steps are as follows:

We must traverse all components of the graph.
Make sure to carry a visited array(all elements are initialized to 0) and a stack data structure, where we are going to store the nodes after completing the DFS call.
In the DFS call, first, the current node is marked as visited. Then DFS call is made for all its adjacent nodes.
After visiting all its adjacent nodes, DFS will backtrack to the previous node and meanwhile, the current node is pushed into the stack.
Finally, we will get the stack containing one of the topological sortings of the graph.



#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
	void dfs(int node, int vis[], stack<int> &st,
	         vector<int> adj[]) {
		vis[node] = 1;
		for (auto it : adj[node]) {
			if (!vis[it]) dfs(it, vis, st, adj);
		}
		st.push(node);
	}
public:
	//Function to return list containing vertices in Topological order.
	vector<int> topoSort(int V, vector<int> adj[])
	{
		int vis[V] = {0};
		stack<int> st;
		for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
			if (!vis[i]) {
				dfs(i, vis, st, adj);
			}
		}

		vector<int> ans;
		while (!st.empty()) {
			ans.push_back(st.top());
			st.pop();
		}
		return ans;
	}
};


int main() {

	//V = 6;
	vector<int> adj[6] = {{}, {}, {3}, {1}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}};
	int V = 6;
	Solution obj;
	vector<int> ans = obj.topoSort(V, adj);

	for (auto node : ans) {
		cout << node << " ";
	}
	cout << endl;

	return 0;
}






Time Complexity: O(V+E)+O(V), where V = no. of nodes and E = no. of edges. There can be at most V components. So, another O(V) time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(2N) + O(N) ~ O(2N): O(2N) for the visited array and the stack carried during DFS calls and O(N) for recursive stack space, where N = no. of nodes.
